Run server (Server.bat) first, then client (Client.bat)

Implementation (How the program works)
I first created a connection for the server and client using port 6066, then created a rsakey function in both classes that made a public and private key pair for both alice (client ) and bob (server). Once the key pair was created, I sent the public key of alice to bob and the public key of bob to alice. (Note: We assumed they already knew each other public key). 
For the first communication, Alice (client) created a secret key. Then, this secret key was encrypted using bob’s public key (RSA) through the encryptKey function. After encryption, the key was sent to bob (server) where he decrypted (decryptkey function) the key using his private key. 
In the algorithm function of the client class, Alice first compute the digest of her 2000 byte message using sha-256, then signs the digest with her private key. Next, alice encrypts her 2000 byte message with the secret key using AES. The signed digest and the encryption cipher-text were sent to Bob (server).
Once Bob receives the signed digest and the encrypted message, he first decrypts the message (decryptmsg function) then he compute the digest of the message using sha-256 as well. Bob then verifies the digest using alice’s public key. If the digest is verified the message is confirmed. 
For the second communication, Bob and Alice create a secret key using Diffe-Hellman key exchange.  Bob (Server) creates p and g, then computes B = g^b mod p which are both sent to Alice. Next, Alice compute A = g^a mod p and sends it to Bob. They both compute g ^AB mod p in the DiffeKey function in both classes.  They now have a secret key which will be used to encrypt bob’s message.
Next Bob creates another secret key, which is encrypted using Alice public key and sent to Alice where it is decrypted similarly to the first secret key.
In the algorithm function in the Server class, bob first computes a hmac with sha256 using the secret key he created. Next, bob encrypts his 1000 byte message with the secret key from the differ-hellam key exchange with alice using AES. The hmac and the encrypted message are sent to Alice.
Alice first decrypts the message (decryptmsg function) then computes the hmac of the message using the secret she got from bob. She then check is the hmac she computed matches the hmac she received, if they match the message is confirmed.
